Brian Tkatch and David Carciente

This repo contains the files related to the Soen 357 research project.

The project consists of a Joonbot chatbot, custom landing pages, and the research
papers.

[**Talk to Planbot**][planbot]

## Joonbot

The chatbot sequence is hosted on Joonbot. We used a deterministic chatbot flow as
AI-based chatbots cannot be tested. Unfortunately, Joonbot chatbots are proprietary and
cannot be exported, however, we have included an image of the chatbot flow configuration
and the custom JavaScript we run within Joonbot to determine the user's ideal plan size.

The Joonbot files are in the `joonbot/` directory.

You can access the hosted Joonbot [here][planbot].

## GitHub Pages

The landing pages are hosted on GitHub pages. The source code for these pages is in the
`docs/` directory (this is a limitation of GitHub Pages).

## Research and Observations

The project research and observations (the first deliverable paper) is located in the
`project-research-observations/` directory. The compiled PDF file is in the root of the
project.
